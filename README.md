## Introduction
For the final project, I choosed articles of Peter Hessler as my research dataset. Peter Hessler is a staff writer at The New Yorker. He is the magazineâ€™s correspondent in China from 2000 to 2007. He was based in Egypy from 2011 to 2016. Most of the subjects of his articles are about these two countries, but also include a small-town druggist in Colorado.
I was reading his latest post when the final assignment requests released, and his ties to China and Colorado led me to choose his post as the dataset.
